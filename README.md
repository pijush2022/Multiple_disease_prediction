# Multiple Disease Prediction System



This project aims to predict multiple diseases using health-related data sourced from Kaggle. The process involves several steps:

Data Preprocessing: The raw data is preprocessed to clean, transform, and prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization: Exploratory data analysis techniques are applied to gain insights into the data, followed by visualization to present key findings visually.

Machine Learning Model Development: A multi-class classification machine learning model is built using the preprocessed data. This model is trained to predict the occurrence of various diseases based on input features.

Model Deployment: The trained model is saved in pickle format for easy deployment and reuse.

User Interface (UI) Development: An interactive and user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit. This interface allows users to input relevant data and obtain predictions for multiple diseases in a single UI.

Running Procedure:

1. Create a virtual environment using the command python -m venv venv_name.
2. Activate the virtual environment using venv_name\Scripts\activate.
3. Install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook file .ipynb if the model needs adjustments.
5. Alternatively, directly run the Python script Multiple_Disease_Pred.py using Streamlit with the command streamlit run    Multiple_Disease_Pred.py.
6. This project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting and managing multiple diseases, with a focus on usability and effectiveness.
